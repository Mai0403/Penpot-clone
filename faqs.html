      <h1 class="font-bold text-5xl">Why Penpot?</h1>
      <p class="mt-12 text-2xl text-gray-800 leading-loose">These are questions related to the fact that Penpot even exists or<br> what is particularly different and new about it.
      </p>

      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">Who created Penpot? Why?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">
        There is a company called <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">Kaleidos Open Source</a> that has been long known for its
        commitment to free & open source software and a more diverse and inclusive workplace
        where cross-domain teams really enjoy working together. Kaleidos launched <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">Taiga</a> a few
        years ago to deal with the absence of a truly agile open source project management tool.
        The next major pain in our ranked list of outrageous open source absentees was a design &
        prototype tool like Figma, Sketch or Invision.<br>

        <br>At Kaleidos we believe that the tools that we use to build end products should be as
        accessible to everyone, regardless of their background, skills or purchasing power. Also, not
        having a free & open source UX/UI tool that would make devs participate in the design
        process and bridge the gap between UX/UI and code was a terrible itch for us.<br>

        <br>We created Penpot out of the need to enjoy design freedom for cross-domain teams.
      </p>


      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">Why specifically Open Source?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">It’s our very personal choice to make sure that we create tools that inject more freedom into the system. Open Source means pursuing a fairer society, where opportunities are more evenly distributed. Software Technology has the unique advantage, compared to other industries and intellectual property, of having almost zero cost to replicate itself, thus providing a wonderful chance to massively distribute the tools for a more digitally sovereign society.<br>

        <br>Besides the pure license aspect of it and its legal framework, Open Source fosters more engaging communities where the lines between user and contributor are often blurred.<br>
        
        <br>In particular, we chose the very respected Mozilla Public License 2.0 because it made software delivered through the web or a service subject to the same rules as software that runs natively on your operating system.
      </p>

      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">Why is SVG its native format?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">SVG (Scalar Vector Graphics) is a widely used Open Standard by the W3C. It permeates the web, the mobile world and visualisation outputs across a myriad of platforms.<br>

        <br>Embracing SVG was a technical challenge but it was a huge opportunity too. It makes a Penpot design itself valid code already. Moreover, the potential for integrations and interoperability are infinite.<br>
        
        <br>When you are certain that a part of your design is SVG and you live-export that SVG as part of your code repository, you can have back and forth changes through the SVG files. Also, a “continuous design” process could be finally at hand.<br>
        
        <br>Using SVG means that there is no translation between a design and its “mathematical” representation. The design is the SVG and the SVG is the design. This is a triumph for cross-domain collaboration.
      </p>


      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">Why is Penpot different from [X proprietary<br> product]?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">It would be tempting to go on a feature-comparison mode here. That’s not going to happen. In terms of functionality Penpot is just fine already and with every new month, we will be bridging the gap between other well-known tools (founded between 2010 and 2012) and our hectic release cycle.<br>

        <br>What is really different is the combination of four key elements:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-decimal ml-8 mt-6 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6 space-y-8">
        <li> <span class="font-bold">Open Source.</span> This is a game-changer for the design and prototype world. It means you can trust your designs are your own. You can adapt or improve the code or benefit from others doing so. You can host your own Penpot instance (also, native app in the works). You can integrate it the way you want. There’s no limit with technology sovereignty.</li>
        <li><span class="font-bold">SVG.</span>The fact that we don’t go for yet another proprietary format is a blow of fresh air. SVG is what code needs and wants, making the cooperation between design and code suddenly much easier.</li>
        <li><span class="font-bold">Cross-domain team focus.</span>Teams that are able to integrate many different skills and backgrounds and still enjoy a fruitful conversation (and project) are amazing to watch. Penpot aims to deliver the perfect tool for visual designers that is wholeheartedly embraced by developers too.</li>
        <li><span class="font-bold">No platform dependencies.</span>Penpot requires a browser, that’s it. If you want to host your own Penpot instance, that’s fine too. We plan to release a native app bundle later this year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">There is a theme here. Universal access. That’s why we love to call our product Penpot, there’s nothing more personal and yet more universal than a pot full of pens. It’s all about choice.
      </p>


      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">Why did you develop Penpot using Clojure and<br> Clojurescript?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">Penpot is a very specific type of tool that demands high performance on the web. Penpot also has the challenging task of seamlessly manipulating zillions of mathematical objects with no information loss. Functional programming languages like Clojure excel at this.<br> 

        <br> It is one of those instances where you absolutely need a specific technology to be able to achieve a robust tool like Penpot in a short period of time.<br> 
        
        <br>Since Clojure is not (yet?) a mainstream programming language, we are making sure that there will be ways to extend Penpot using other more common languages such as Javascript. Also, at the backend level, appropriate APIs will be in place to easily connect Penpot with other platforms.
      </p>


      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">Why did you release Penpot as an Alpha?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">We couldn’t wait any longer. Back in February 2020 we promised that it would take as a year to develop a sort of 1.0. The “alpha” tag might be misleading, it’s quite stable and feature-rich but in some ways it’s still immature with regards to our vision.
      </p>


      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">Why did Penpot move to Beta?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">Penpot is labeled as beta from the beginning of November 2021. Since its public launch in February 2021, Penpot capabilities and benefits have grown at an astonishing fast rate. Meanwhile, we constantly came back to one recurring question: Is Penpot really an alpha product anymore?<br>

        <br>The combination of core features, maturity, stability and how comfortable teams seem to be while using it made the trick. Also, we saw amazing validation from the community as a whole (take a look at our github). Learn more about the details behind the change <a class="text-green-500 underline" href="">here</a>.<br>
        
        <br>Anyway, enjoy it for what it is, we will keep releasing iterations of our hopeful plans.

      <h1 class="font-bold text-5xl">How Penpot?</h1>
      <p class="mt-12 text-2xl text-gray-800 leading-loose">These are questions related to practical aspects of Penpot or its capabilities.
      </p>

      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">How do you plan to make Penpot’s<br> development sustainable?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6"> <a class="text-green-500 underline" href="">Kaleidos Open Source</a>, the company behind Penpot, has the resources and the team needed to do that. If Penpot really succeeds and demands more and more resources, a bigger team and a bigger infrastructure, we will need to find ways to monetize some aspects of Penpot. Many Open Source platforms have been very successful at that, without reverting to closing up the source code.<br>

        <br>SaaS subscriptions offer a quite valid and straightforward business model on top of Open Source. We are also considering marketplace models à-la-Wordpress or big-enterprise-focused features for supported Penpot deployments à-la-Gitlab. No bullshit Open Core models based on some iteration of a “Tax the rich” sound reasonable but we’re still unsure about what would make sense. At the moment, though, this is something we don’t plan to address until 2023.<br>
        
        <br>If you would like to know more about our track record, just take a look at Taiga and its AGPL 3.0 licensing model. It’s great to have first-hand experience.
      </p>


      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">What is this "Kaleidos Ventures SL" stuff I see<br> when I do some research on who's behind<br> Penpot? You guys are a VC or what?#
      </h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">No, we're not. Kaleidos Ventures SL is just a private rebranding of Kaleidos Open Source SL. It's the same bunch of people that 10 years ago created a company to build digital products for other startups. Many of us had been free & open source enthusiasts and hackers for over 10 years (mid 90's) already back then, so we wanted to make sure we stood behind our values around technology and society. <br> 
        
        <br> Thanks to our internal innovation and incubation process (<a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">ΠWEEK</a>), <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">Taiga</a>, was born a few years ago. In recent times, we also needed something like Penpot, so we created an internal prototype, after which we asked ourselves whether it would be challenging but also cool to ditch all third-party consultancy contracts and just focus on OUR free & open source products. We said "Yes! Let's do this!". To name this risky and exciting business shift during pandemic times, it was convenient to create a child company, Kaleidos Ventures SL, and we asked for a bit of seed money to make sure we could build a solid professional tool, but the transition has been flawless and our <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">main website</a> has remained almost the same, which is very nice.<br> 

        <br> If you'd like to listen to Kaleidos Ventures SL CEO, there's <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">this no-bullshit non-confirming interview</a> by Clayton Dewey which got featured at <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">opensource.com</a>.<br> 
        
        <br> This FAQ entry was inspired by a question from Aral Balkan on Mastodon.

      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">How can I download and install Penpot for my team?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">Current private Penpot instances are only requiring basic Docker knowledge. You can run your own Penpot server following these instructions:<br>
        <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">help.penpot.app/technical-guide/getting-started</a><br>
        
        <br>There’s a community contribution around a docker-less deployment using podman:
        <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">blog.linuxgrrl.com/2022/01/19/running-penpot-locally-docker-free-with-podman</a>
      </p>


      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">How can I make Penpot work offline?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">At the moment that would require that you install Penpot locally and so you connect to localhost. Instructions for this using Docker can be found here:<br>
        <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">https://help.penpot.app/technical-guide/getting-started/ </a> <br>

         <br>For a simpler approach, more akin to downloading a piece of software and running it on top of your operating system, please wait for our Electron-based app bundle later this year.
      </p>


      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">How can I join the community chat?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">You can jump in right here <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">https://gitter.im/penpot/community </a><br>

      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">How can I use Penpot together with Inkscape?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">Inkscape is a very powerful Open Source vector drawing tool. At Penpot we use it daily for our SVG creations. A very common use case we have is to use Inkscape to work with vector illustrations, icon sets and other graphic assets, before importing them into Penpot to create more complete and visually attractive interface designs. There are other tools that can complete your workflow, such as Quant-UX, which is very good for learning about your users’ interactions with your product.
      </p>


      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">How can I learn how to use Penpot?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">Right now, our suggested approach would be to take a look at our <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">Youtube channel </a>  and enjoy the quick tutorials on many aspects of Penpot.
      </p>

      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">How can I contribute to Penpot?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">We are working on a comprehensive guide on how to contribute to Penpot. There are many ways this can be achieved. Designs, code, testing, reporting bugs, improving documentation, sharing Penpot designs with #MadeWithPenpot, translating Penpot to your favourite language, setting up training sessions, etc.<br>

        <br> For now, we have a rather limited  <a class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black" href="">contribution guide</a> that you can already use but we plan to improve this very soon.

      </p>

      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12">What is in Penpot’s roadmap for the short-/mid-term?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">Some of the things planned for the near future:
      </p>
      <ul class="ml-6 list-disc mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6 space-y-6">
        <li>Responsive layout (also known as autolayout).</li>
        <li>Advanced components (states, variants, interactions).</li>
        <li>Sharing options with fine grained permissions.</li>
        <li>[2022 - Q4] Taiga confluence, API and plugin framework.</li>
        <li>... and much more.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">You can check the advance of the project at <a href="" class="text-green-500 underline hover:text-black">Taiga</a>.</p>

      <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mt-12 w-4/6">Did the team find a pattern (design, interaction, tool) that could be improved but decided to keep it because the reference tools already made it familiar to the user?</h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed w-4/6">Short answer would be no, we do not keep things from improving because of the potential loss of familiarity.<br>

        <br> It is true that we are using known patterns to ease the learning curve, this is part of Penpot’s strategy. Given that, we could say that “familiar” is included in our definition of success, but this might be for a different, also interesting, conversation. We do not hide that we have kept an eye not only on Figma but also on many other “usual suspects” (Sketch, Adobe XD, Inkscape, Webflow, Blender...) to study common patterns. However, our design decisions are based not only on previous research but also on testing solutions with users. Therefore, if we were to find that something works better for us in a different way, we’d go for it. Masks and toolbars are some examples of this approach.
